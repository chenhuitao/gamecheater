  - Complete the source code. Test it on some games.
  - v0.1 release. First release.

# 2005-08-05  Alf <h980501427@hotmail.com>
  - Fix some memory leaks.

  - Change the statusbar of search dialog to progressbar for better UI.
    Search "0" maybe needs a long time, because there are so many "0" in the 
    memory, call appending GSList function takes lots of time. The program 
    looks like have been dead. Which memory is unuseless and should be 
    skipped?

  - Read the /proc/%pid%/exe symbolic link file to get the whole process 
    executable binary filename.
  - Set the search window's title "%pid% - name".
  - Skip the stopped process. It would block waitpid().
  - Skip the process which has been traced.
  - Change ADDRESS_COLUMN, using GTYPE_UINT. Add addr_cell_data_func() to 
    display address.
  - Add "auto" search type as default type. Set default focus at SpinButton.
  - Add a str2uint() function, instead of atoi(), strtoul(). Not support 
    octal. If the str_value is too big and is out of the uint range, only get 
    the low-digit value, ignore high-digit. If you select search type uint8 
    and input seach value - 0x101, because of 0x101 is out of the uint8 range, 
    the true search value is 0x01. If you are not sure which type is fit in 
    with the search value, select auto type. 
  - Fix a bug at search_value(). The addr memory offset is double increased 
    when appending the result GSList.

  - Add arguments check in some functions.
  - Change get_mem_preview(). Arguments len is confused, it is text length, 
    not memory length. Now it is the memory length. Disply text convert work 
    move to the refresh function.
  - Add command-line parser, only show version.
  - Change struct cheater_t. Remove u8, u16, u32, u64 because of this 
    program is highly OS and architecture specific, instead of guint value.
    This program now is only tested under my i386 GNU/Linux. If you have any 
    suggestion or problem under other platform, PLZ email to me. Thanks.

  - Change update_value(). Now it can update memory by value length.
  - Change search_value(). First get a block memory, then compare the content 
    by the type. 
  - v0.2 release.

# 2005-08-11  Alf <h980501427@hotmail.com>
  - Change unsigned int to unsigned long. Type int under 32-bit and 64-bit 
    paltform is 32-bit length, long is same bit-length with platform. Modify 
    all the places which use GUINT_TO_POINTER macro. Under 64-bit platform, 
    pointer is 64-bit length. For 64-bit compatibility.
  - Change cheater->value type to guint64;
  - Change ADDRESS_COLUMN, using GTYPE_ULONG.
  - Change spin_button to text_entry for accept hexadecimal number.
  - Rename str2uint() to str2u64(), convert string to MAX supported number.
  - Enable uint64 type.

# 2005-08-12  Alf <h980501427@hotmail.com>
  - v0.3 release.
