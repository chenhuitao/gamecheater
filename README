  It use "ptrace" system call to edit other process' memory.

  This program is highly OS and architecture specific. Now it is only tested 
under my GNU/Linux. If you have any suggestion or problem under other
platform, please email to me. Thanks.

Requirements:
  1. Linux-2.6+
  2. Glib-2.6+
  3. Gtk+-3.0+

Howto use:
  1. Select your interested process, double-click the row.
  2. Select search type and input your wanted value in new dialog.
  3. Press "ENTER" at value input entry to start search.
  4. Wait.
  5. The sum of matched addresses is showed at statusbar, but treeview
     only display 8 rows.
  6. Repeat 2-5. Maybe you would skip this step if you had found the 
     address.
  7. Double-click the row which you trusted, input a new value to update 
     memory. Or right-click the row, select "edit memory" to update more.

Warning:
  Modify other process' memory is dangerous, unless you know what you 
are doing. Please save your game and works before update the memory.
